8. VALIDATION SUMMARY
═══════════════════════════════════════════════

✅ Regional Variation:
   - London has highest Premium (9.2%) and lowest Value (2.0%)
   - Wales has highest Value (12.5%) and low Premium (6.5%)
   - North West has low Premium (5.2%) and high Value (9.1%)

✅ Density does NOT affect demographics:
   - Urban, Suburban, Rural show similar segment distributions
   - This is CORRECT: density affects competition/context, not catchment demographics

✅ Context does NOT affect demographics:
   - residential, mixed, transit, office_core show similar segment distributions
   - This is CORRECT: context affects store choice, not catchment demographics

✅ Micro-catchment populations reflect PURE GEOGRAPHY:
   - Regional baselines dominate (London vs Wales vs North)
   - ±15% jitter creates store-level variation
   - NO retailer/format/context bias (those belong in File 3)

✅ READY FOR FILE 2: cluster-population.json aggregation
